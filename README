*pyGtk-notifiysnippet*

This is a simple snippet I'm hoping to get working and
refactor one day to avoid importing another library. Add your threading 
to the pot as needed.

Changelog
==========
v0.02
- fixed event recognition. 

v0.01
Very ruff outline of how I thought the snippet should work
- the message dialog doesn't die
- timer doesn't work, either
- events (clicking or mousing over the dialog) are not being recognized
